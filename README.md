Notes for the future:
	add a notable work section
	link visualizations

	maybe a slowly animated circle packing diagram in the background???? With a toggle button to disable it ;)

	link the speaking center










	Other life notes:
		update TomatoClock for Nexus
		Use Raspberry Pi for something
		Do some stats analysis to put on a website

		Dare I say... a Mathologer split-format style video of me presenting something? :)
